                      Most successful websites record a range of data. This
                      includes tracking how visitors behave, your best traffic
                      sources, and the content that drives the most conversions.
                      By regularly analysing your metrics, you can pinpoint
                      problems that need to be addressed. Here, speed is

                      Creating regular backups is one of the most important
                      items on your to-do list. If you fall behind, then you
                      risk losing all of your recent work — or even your entire
                      website. While you can create backups manually, some
                      hosting providers can perform this vital maintenance task
                      for you. For example, at Appideas, we offer automated
                      daily backups.

                      A lively comment section encourages visitors to interact
                      with your site. However, comment sections can have a dark
                      side. Attackers may try to trick you into publishing
                      malicious content in the form of comment spam. Some
                      comments may also contain irrelevant or offensive content.
                      This can reflect poorly on your website. For this reason,
                      you may want to use a comment moderation plugin such as
                      Akismet Anti-Spam.
